# ajax-pokedex

This is an exercise to program a pokédex.
the pokédex draws it's data from the following API: https://pokeapi.co/
It's made as an exercise for the Becode course and is currently a work in progress.

##Objectives

-[x] You can search a pokémon by name and by ID
 Of said pokémon you need to show:
 
-[x] The ID-number

-[x] An image (sprite).

-[x] At least 4 "moves"

-[x] The previous evolution, only if it exists, along with their name and image. Be carefull, you cannot just do ID-1 to get the previous form, for example look into "magmar" - "magmortar". You have to use a seperate api call for this!
